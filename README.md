To get started its pretty easy you need either npm or pnpm which can be installed by running: `npm i -g pnpm` and then just need to the run following command

```bash
pnpm i && pnpm start # Replace pnpm with npm if your not going to use pnpm
```

and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) you should be good to go!

If you are developing/modifying terbium you can just run `pnpm run dev`, **DO NOT** use the development server for Production use instead just run `pnpm start`. For any further backend configuration visit the `.env` file to configure the backend a bit.
